What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It sets that folder as a repository.
You need to do it to be able to work with Git on it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area I see a temporary holding area before you make a commit. I assume it lets you make changes to a file before the final commit.
