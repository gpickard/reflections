What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It sets that folder as a repository.
You need to do it to be able to work with Git on it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area I see a temporary holding area before you make a commit. I assume it lets you make changes to a file before the final commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By checking status on it to see what has been added and make sure it only contains on the files for that logical change.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They show which commits are on each branch and which are unreachable.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
They become one with all the changes that have been added to the 2 branchs. To more easi;y understand how the merge works.
