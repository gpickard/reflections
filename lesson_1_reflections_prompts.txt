How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped speed up the process by showing only what changed between the 2 files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It will allow me to go back and get some piece of code that worked on I lost in the current one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pro: Allows for logical grouping of changes.
Con: May forget to commit when you should.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
This allows compares between commits for a set of files to be much easier.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log ==> allows use to list the history of all the commits
git diff id1 id2  ==> allows you to see the differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It allows me to go back to where the code was working after making changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Add my projects there for version control.
